# verticalTitleTab

Requirement: 
* Show a title tab vertically alongside a content container.

Tricky corners: 
* I wanted to have the height of the tab be exactly the same as the content and to be flush with the content.
* I wanted the title to be read from bottom to top (the user turns their head to the left)
